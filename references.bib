Accurate assignment of the secondary structure elements (SSE) (helix, strand, coil) is an essential step for the analysis and modelling of protein structure. Various methods have been proposed to assign secondary structure. Comparative studies of their results have shown some of their drawbacks, pointing out the difficulties in the task of SSE assignment.Results: We have designed a new automatic method, named P-SEA, to assign efficiently secondary structure from the sole Cα position. Some advantages of the new algorithm are discussed.Availability: The program P-SEA is available by anonymous ftp: ftp.lmcp.jussieu.fr directory:pub/}",

    abstract = "{Highly accurate protein structure predictors have generated hundreds of millions of protein structures; these pose a challenge in terms of storage and processing. Here, we present Foldcomp, a novel lossy structure compression algorithm, and indexing system to address this challenge. By using a combination of internal and Cartesian coordinates and a bi-directional NeRF-based strategy, Foldcomp improves the compression ratio by a factor of three compared to the next best method. Its reconstruction error of 0.08 Å is comparable to the best lossy compressor. It is five times faster than the next fastest compressor and competes with the fastest decompressors. With its multi-threading implementation and a Python interface that allows for easy database downloads and efficient querying of protein structures by accession, Foldcomp is a powerful tool for managing and analysing large collections of protein structures.Foldcomp is a free open-source software (GPLv3) and available for Linux, macOS, and Windows at https://foldcomp.foldseek.com. Foldcomp provides the AlphaFold Swiss-Prot (2.9GB), TrEMBL (1.1TB), and ESMatlas HQ (114GB) database ready-for-download.}",

abstract = {Abstract For a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive Cα positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. The dictionary is also available in computer-readable form for protein structure prediction work.},

The availability of accurate structure predictions on a large scale in AlphaFoldDB offers a fresh perspective on IDR prediction.

Surprisingly, AlphaFoldDB is highly competitive for predicting both IDRs and conditionally folded binding regions, demonstrating the plasticity of the disorder to structure continuum.},

abstract = {Abstract Currently, the prediction of three-dimensional (3D) protein structure from sequence alone is an exceedingly difficult task. As an intermediate step, a much simpler task has been pursued extensively: predicting 1D strings of secondary structure. Here, we present an analysis of another 1D projection from 3D structure: the relative solvent accessibility of each residue. We show that solvent accessibility is less conserved in 3D homologues than is secondary structure, and hence is predicted less accurately from automatic homology modeling; the correlation coefficient of relative solvent accessibility between 3D homologues is only 0.77, and the average accuracy of predictions based on sequence alignments is only 0.68. The latter number provides an effective upper limit on the accuracy of predicting accessibility from sequence when homology modeling is not possible. We introduce a neural network system that predicts relative solvent accessibility (projected onto ten discrete states) using evolutionary profiles of amino acid substitutions derived from multiple sequence alignments. Evaluated in a cross-validation test on 238 unique proteins, the correlation between predicted and observed relative accessibility is 0.54. Interpreted in terms of a three-state (buried, intermediate, exposed) description of relative accessibility, the fraction of correctly predicted residue states is about 58\%. In absolute terms this accuracy appears poor, but given the relatively low conservation of accessibility in 3D families, the network system is not far from its likely optimal performance. The most reliably predicted fraction of the residues (50\%) is predicted as accurately as by automatic homology modeling. Prediction is best for buried residues, e.g., 86\% of the completely buried sites are correctly predicted as having 0\% relative accessibility. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {A computer program is described for calculating the environment and the exposure to solvent of atoms of a protein. The computation is based on the atomic co-ordinates of the protein and on assumptions like those of Lee & Richards (1971). Results for lysozyme and insulin are presented. Changes in exposure to solvent and in the nature of contacts that develop through folding, association reactions and crystallization are described numerically. The computations suggest several generalizations. (a) Lattice contacts within the protein crystal are characterized by a significantly smaller involvement of non-polar side chains and a proportionately greater involvement of ionizable side chains than is found for protein folding or for protein association reactions important for biological function, (b) In helical regions the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue in the helix has high probability of being shielded from solvent, (c) Glycine is among the residues having exposure least affected by folding; this accords with the expectation that it lies at bends of the peptide chain on the surface of the molecule.}
