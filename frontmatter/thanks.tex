I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Alexander Miguel Monzon and my co-supervisor Damiano Piovesan for their essential guidance and insight throughout this journey. I am also very thankful to the entire BioComputingUP laboratory for having welcomed me and provided help and support when I was in need.

I extend my gratitude to my family, my friends and my girlfriend Daniela for her love and support.
